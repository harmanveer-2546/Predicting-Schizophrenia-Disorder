# Prediction and Visualization of Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with 
reality, which can be distressing for them and for their family and friends. The symptoms of schizophrenia can make it difficult to participate in usual, 
everyday activities, but effective treatments are available. Many people who receive treatment can engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships.

It’s important to recognize the symptoms of schizophrenia and seek help as early as possible. People with schizophrenia are usually diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 30,
after the first episode of psychosis. Starting treatment as soon as possible following the first episode of psychosis is an important step toward recovery. However, research 
shows that gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often appear before the first episode of psychosis. Schizophrenia is rare in younger children.

Schizophrenia symptoms can differ from person to person, but they generally fall into three main categories: psychotic, negative, and cognitive.

1. Psychotic symptoms include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the world. A person experiencing psychotic symptoms often has disrupted thoughts
   and perceptions, and they may have difficulty recognizing what is real and what is not. Psychotic symptoms include:

* Hallucinations: When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not actually there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia.
   People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.
* Delusions: When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may seem irrational to others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe
   that people on the radio and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.
* Thought disorder: When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or illogical. People with thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts
   and speech. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have no meaning.

2. Negative symptoms include loss of motivation, loss of interest or enjoyment in daily activities, withdrawal from social life, difficulty showing emotions, and
   difficulty functioning normally. Negative symptoms include:


* Having trouble planning and sticking with activities, such as grocery shopping
* Having trouble anticipating and being motivated by pleasure in everyday life
* Talking in a dull voice and showing limited facial expression
* Avoiding social interaction or interacting in socially awkward ways
* Having shallow energy and spending a lot of time in passive activities. In extreme cases, a person might stop moving or talking for a
  while, which is a rare condition called catatonia.

3. Cognitive symptoms include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. These symptoms can make it hard to follow a conversation, learn new things, or remember appointments.
 A person’s level of cognitive functioning is one of the best predictors of their day-to-day functioning. Health care providers evaluate cognitive functioning
 using specific tests. Cognitive symptoms include:

* Having trouble processing information to make decisions
* Having trouble using information immediately after learning it
* Having trouble focusing or paying attention

### Risk of violence

Most people with schizophrenia are not violent. Overall, people with schizophrenia are more likely than those without the illness to be harmed by others. For people with schizophrenia, the risk of self-harm and of violence to others is greatest when 
the illness is untreated or co-occurs with alcohol or substance misuse. It is important to help people who are showing symptoms to get treatment as quickly as possible.

### What are the risk factors for schizophrenia?

Several factors may contribute to a person’s risk of developing schizophrenia.

1.  Genetics: Schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, just because one family member has schizophrenia, it does not mean that other members of the family also will 
  have it. Studies suggest that many different genes may increase a person’s chances of developing schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself.

2. Environment: Research suggests that a combination of genetic factors and aspects of a person’s environment and life experiences may play a role in the development of
   schizophrenia. These environmental factors that may include living in poverty, stressful or dangerous surroundings, and exposure to viruses or nutritional problems before birth.

4. Brain structure and function: Research shows that people with schizophrenia may be more likely to have differences in the size of certain brain areas and in connections
    between brain areas. Some of these brain differences may develop before birth. Researchers are working to better understand how brain structure and function may relate to schizophrenia.

### Prediction :

The main known risk factors in development of schizophrenia are genetic causes, pregnancy and delivery complications, slow neuromotor development, and deviant cognitive and academic
performance. However, their effect size and predictive power are small.
